# Codebase Project Steps

## Project Setup
- Establish a project timeline and milestones
- Identify the necessary technological stack and resources, including RAG, LangChain, and LLM models

## Data Input Module
- Develop an input module that accepts a zip file containing text-based assignments (Word, PDF, Python notebooks)
- Design a mechanism to extract and process text from these formats for grading

## Grading Criteria Definition
- Implement a system allowing graders to define specific grading criteria and processes for each assignment type
- Ensure the system supports diverse grading metrics and workflows tailored to different assignments

## AI Grading System
- Integrate AI automation flows to grade assignments based on the predefined criteria
- Employ multiple AI models and compare their grading outputs to ensure reliability and consistency

## Grading Consistency and Verification
- Define a protocol for grading each assignment multiple times to verify consistency
- Develop an algorithm to compare grading outcomes across iterations, flagging significant discrepancies for review

## Flagging System
- Create a web interface to display flagged assignments, highlighting variations in grading
- Allow graders to review and adjust grades for flagged assignments, ensuring accuracy

## Result Compilation and Reporting
- Generate comprehensive reports detailing each assignment's grade, confidence levels, and variation across grading iterations
- Include constructive feedback based on grading metrics, offering insights into areas of improvement for students

## Testing and Iteration
- Conduct thorough testing of the system with a variety of assignment samples
- Gather feedback from potential users and refine the system based on this input

## Future Expansion
- Plan for the incorporation of more complex assignment types, including those with embedded images or code, in subsequent phases of the project

## Documentation and Dissemination
- Document the development process, system architecture, and user instructions
- Prepare a paper or presentation to share the research findings on AI model reliability in grading

## Expected Outcomes
- An operational automated grading system that enhances grading efficiency and consistency
- Insights into the effectiveness and reliability of different AI models in the educational grading context
